# Google-Spreadsheet-Booker
Automatic insert data to a google spreadsheet.

During the pandemic, several organizers have chosen to handle registration with google spreadsheet. 

My motivation for this script comes from a local quiz in my community. It was hard to get tables since people were quick and the amount of tables was limited. The quiz organizers used the same google spreadsheet every week. With this script I did not need to think about booking and I got a table each week. 

**NOTE**
If you are going to use this script, you will need to rewrite some of the script to fit with your needs. The script is optimized for my personal need, and to work as efficient as possible for my problem.
